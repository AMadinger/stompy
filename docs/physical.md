Ridetech 4.1" HQ coilover shocks 600 lb/in springs
Given ~6000 lb weight of robot, with tripod gate, expect full travel (2460 lbs per leg).


Weights
====
- hip: 51 lbs
- thigh: 135 lbs
- upper calf: 87 lbs
- linkage: 8.4 lbs (x2)
- lower calf: 39.4 lbs
- ankle: 3.2 lbs
- foot: 21 lbs (taken from CAD)

353 lbs per leg (plus cylinders, hoses, pins, fasteners) maybe another 100 lbs? so let's say 450 lbs per leg

- engine: ~780 lbs
- oil (assuming 18 gallons): ~130 lbs
- reservoir: 71 lbs
- spine: ?
- roll cage: ?
- engine cage: ?

Total robot weighs: 7800 lbs (measured 181202 with hydraulic scaled calibrated on a proving ring).

6 legs x 450 lbs per leg = 2700 lbs of legs (~34% of robot weight)
spine + engine + oil + tanks + pumps + roll cage + etc = 5100 lbs
